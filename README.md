##Welcome to RubyJobs!

RubyJobs is a one stop shop to see what's happening in the community, search for a job/developer, advertise your company/yourself, message our mailing list, create a company/personal bio and lastly we are working on a 'job matching system' to help send relevant opportunities to the correct people automatically.

- When will RubyJobs be ready?
 - Late 2016

######Thanks to  community input RubyJobs is 100% free and is riding Ruby On Rails

##Why would I use RubyJobs?

- It's purely for Ruby Jobs and nothing else. It's pretty good like that.
- Job matching is coming meaning no more scrolling through job boards. You can be matched with appropriate jobs.
- RubyJobs was built by the community for the community. We help our users to know what Ruby events are on, what sites are worth visiting and have an open forum to discuss ruby related topics


## FAQ

- I'm looking for a Java developer. May I advertise on your site?
 - No
- Does advertising cost any money?
 - Advertising with RubyJobs is free. It comes with the caveat that we do impose criteria on advertisments such that the job board remains as clear as possible to Job Seekers.
 - Don't worry we still understand the nature of recruitment and some things such as salary can remain hidden if they need to.
 - We are understanding of recruitment needs however; wherever possible we promote as much transparacy  as possible. We don't want our job board being filled with vague jobs where details are vague etc... We promote detail so that developers using the site can make educated applications.
 - This site was built with the help of an ex-recruitment agent so we do know what we are doing!
